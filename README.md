### Course Summary  
Today I learned several fundamental concepts in software development, focusing on planning, documentation, and team collaboration practices.  

---

### 1. Understanding Application Needs  
- **User Requirement Specification (URS):** Records user needs in non-technical language so that it can be understood by all stakeholders (managers, developers, users, etc.).  
  - Requirement gathering techniques: *Interviews, User Stories, Straw Man, Prototyping*.  
- **Application Technical Specification:** Contains detailed information about functionality, services, and technical limitations. It must be **clear, unambiguous, complete, and consistent**.  

---

### 2. Application Modification Planning  
- **Software Requirement Specification (SRS):** Created before development to explain how an application will work, including its **functional and non-functional requirements**. Provides a clear picture for the UI/UX team, testers, end-users, and investors.  
- **Functional vs. Non-functional Requirements:**  
  - Functional → Core features.  
  - Non-functional → Performance, security, usability, etc.

### 3. Application Communication with Computers  
- **Compiler vs. Interpreter:** Both act as a "bridge" translating programming languages into machine code.  
  - Compiler → Converts all the code at once, creating an executable file.  
  - Interpreter → Reads and executes code line by line.

### 4. Problem Solving with Computational Thinking  
Five key techniques:  
1. **Decomposition:** Breaking a large problem into smaller parts.  
2. **Pattern Recognition:** Identifying similarities and differences across problems.  
3. **Abstraction:** Focusing on essential information and ignoring irrelevant details.  
4. **Algorithm:** Creating a logical, step-by-step sequence to solve a problem.  
5. **Evaluation:** Reviewing the solution to see how it worked.  

- **Flowchart:** Learned the basic symbols to visually represent a workflow or algorithm.

### 5. Basic Programming Concepts  
- **Syntax:** Rules that govern how code is written (e.g., case-sensitive, semicolons).  
- **General Basics:**  
  - Variables → Store data.  
  - Data Types → Numeric, Boolean, Text.  
  - Logic → IF/Else, Looping.  
- **JavaScript Basics:**  
  - Role in web development.  
  - `let` and `const`.  
  - Core concepts: *Sequence, Selection, Looping*.

### 6. Software Application Modification  
- **HTML & CSS:**  
  - **HTML** (Hypertext Markup Language) → Structure of a web page.  
  - **CSS** (Cascading Style Sheets) → Styling and visual presentation.  

---

### 7. Programming and Software Development Documentation  
- **Version Control System (Git & GitHub):** Git → Tracks code changes; GitHub → Collaboration & repository hosting.  
- **Style Guide & Code Comments:** Ensure consistency across teams and explain complex parts of code.  
- **Technical Documentation:** Helps teams and users understand a product. Includes user guides, technical specifications, and development guides.
