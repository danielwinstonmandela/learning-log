### Course Summary  
Today I finished learning key concepts related to **logic, algorithms, computational thinking, and logic gates**.  

---

### üìñ Glossary  
- **Hypothesis (H):** Something assumed to be true for the sake of reasoning or argument (theory, proposition, etc.) even though it still needs to be proven; a basic assumption (KBBI).  
- **Premise (P):** Something considered true as the foundation of a conclusion; basis of reasoning; assumption (KBBI).  
- **Variable (V):** A container used to store a value that can change.

### üìù Introduction Summary  
- **Programming logic** is a basic ability to apply logical operations on data within computer science.  
- Logic helps with **problem-solving**, while an **algorithm** structures the solution.  

**Characteristics of an algorithm:**  
1. **Finiteness:** Must stop once all steps are completed.  
2. **Definiteness:** Each step must be clear, detailed, and unambiguous.  
3. **Effectiveness:** Must be efficient and not excessive.  
4. **Input:** Requires zero or more inputs before execution.  
5. **Output:** Produces one or more outputs from the given inputs.  

**Types of logical reasoning:**  
- **Inductive:** Drawing conclusions from observations and prior knowledge.  
- **Deductive:** Deriving certain conclusions from general and specific premises (e.g., syllogism).  

**Types of programming logic:**  
- **Arithmetic Logic:** Solving problems involving mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, etc.).  
- **Comparison Logic:** Comparing two values/conditions.  
- **Looping Logic:** Repeating instructions under certain conditions (avoiding duplicate code ‚Üí more efficient).

### üîå Logic Gate Summary  
- **Logic Gate:** A digital circuit that processes Boolean logic ‚Üí produces output `0` (false) or `1` (true).  
- **Truth Table:** Shows input combinations and their corresponding outputs.  

**7 Types of Logic Gates:**  
1. **AND:** Output `1` if all inputs are `1`.  
2. **OR:** Output `1` if at least one input is `1`.  
3. **NOT:** Inverts the input (`1` ‚Üí `0`, `0` ‚Üí `1`).  
4. **NAND:** Opposite of AND.  
5. **NOR:** Opposite of OR.  
6. **XOR:** Output `1` if inputs are different.  
7. **XNOR:** Output `1` if inputs are the same.

### üí° Computational Thinking Summary  
**Computational thinking** ‚Üí structured problem-solving, similar to how a computer executes instructions.  

**Five elements of computational thinking:**  
1. **Decomposition:** Breaking a big problem into smaller, manageable parts.  
2. **Pattern Recognition:** Identifying similarities and differences across problems.  
3. **Abstraction:** Focusing on essential details while ignoring irrelevant ones.  
4. **Algorithms:** Creating a structured, step-by-step sequence (using pseudocode & flowcharts).  
   - *Flowchart:* Visual representation of steps and decisions.  
   - *Pseudocode:* Algorithm written in human-readable form.  
5. **Evaluation:** Reviewing and testing the solution before moving to the next problem.

## August 16, 2025  
### Course Summary  
Today I learned several fundamental concepts in software development, focusing on planning, documentation, and team collaboration practices.  

---

### 1. Understanding Application Needs  
- **User Requirement Specification (URS):** Records user needs in non-technical language so that it can be understood by all stakeholders (managers, developers, users, etc.).  
  - Requirement gathering techniques: *Interviews, User Stories, Straw Man, Prototyping*.  
- **Application Technical Specification:** Contains detailed information about functionality, services, and technical limitations. It must be **clear, unambiguous, complete, and consistent**.  

---

### 2. Application Modification Planning  
- **Software Requirement Specification (SRS):** Created before development to explain how an application will work, including its **functional and non-functional requirements**. Provides a clear picture for the UI/UX team, testers, end-users, and investors.  
- **Functional vs. Non-functional Requirements:**  
  - Functional ‚Üí Core features.  
  - Non-functional ‚Üí Performance, security, usability, etc.  

---

### 3. Application Communication with Computers  
- **Compiler vs. Interpreter:** Both act as a "bridge" translating programming languages into machine code.  
  - Compiler ‚Üí Converts all the code at once, creating an executable file.  
  - Interpreter ‚Üí Reads and executes code line by line.

### 4. Problem Solving with Computational Thinking  
Five key techniques:  
1. **Decomposition:** Breaking a large problem into smaller parts.  
2. **Pattern Recognition:** Identifying similarities and differences across problems.  
3. **Abstraction:** Focusing on essential information and ignoring irrelevant details.  
4. **Algorithm:** Creating a logical, step-by-step sequence to solve a problem.  
5. **Evaluation:** Reviewing the solution to see how it worked.  

- **Flowchart:** Learned the basic symbols to visually represent a workflow or algorithm.  

---

### 5. Basic Programming Concepts  
- **Syntax:** Rules that govern how code is written (e.g., case-sensitive, semicolons).  
- **General Basics:**  
  - Variables ‚Üí Store data.  
  - Data Types ‚Üí Numeric, Boolean, Text.  
  - Logic ‚Üí IF/Else, Looping.  
- **JavaScript Basics:**  
  - Role in web development.  
  - `let` and `const`.  
  - Core concepts: *Sequence, Selection, Looping*.

### 6. Software Application Modification  
- **HTML & CSS:**  
  - **HTML** (Hypertext Markup Language) ‚Üí Structure of a web page.  
  - **CSS** (Cascading Style Sheets) ‚Üí Styling and visual presentation.  

---

### 7. Programming and Software Development Documentation  
- **Version Control System (Git & GitHub):** Git ‚Üí Tracks code changes; GitHub ‚Üí Collaboration & repository hosting.  
- **Style Guide & Code Comments:** Ensure consistency across teams and explain complex parts of code.  
- **Technical Documentation:** Helps teams and users understand a product. Includes user guides, technical specifications, and development guides.
